# Excel_Bike-Buyers_Dashbboard

## Project Overview :
This Excel project involves creating a comprehensive dashboard for bike sales, utilizing data cleaning, pivot tables, and visualizations. The purpose of this repository is to look at what factors may go in to determining whether or not a customer opts to purchase a bike. The dashboard displayed below is interactive upon downloading the Bike Buyers Data Excel Sheet in the main branch.

## Dataset :
* The project utilizes the Bike Buyers 1000 dataset.

## Steps Performed :
**1. Data Cleaning:** Identify and remove duplicates, standardize categorical data (e.g., marital status, gender).
**2. Create Working Sheet:** Copy raw data to a working sheet for manipulation, keeping the original data intact.
**3. Pivot Tables:** Utilize pivot tables to summarize and analyze data for visualization.
**4. Visualizations:** Build visualizations using recommended charts to represent key insights, such as average income, commute distance, and age brackets.
**5. Dashboard Creation:** Copy visualizations onto a dashboard sheet for a consolidated view.
**6. Chart Customization:** Adjust chart titles, axis labels, and formatting for better clarity.

## Dashboard Insights :
+ **Average Income by Gender and Bike Purchase:** Understand the average income of individuals based on gender and whether they purchased a bike.
+ **Customer Commute Distance:** Analyze the distribution of customers based on their commute distance and bike purchase status.
+ **Customer Age Brackets:** Explore bike sales across different age brackets, categorizing customers as adolescent, middle-aged, and old.

## Recommendations : 
Since it is unclear whether or not the purchase of the bike was solely for a commute, more data will be needed to draw conclusive results. A recommendation for anyone wishing to repeat the study to gather the data would be to add a question about the purpose of the bike purchase: travel/commute, leisure/play, exercise, sport.
